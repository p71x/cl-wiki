This is original, outdated and unmaintained from 2008 year version 
of cl-wiki (version 0.3.2, last version publisched on 
http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-wiki/). It does'not work 
with current (year 2014) version of hunhentoot.

=========   ---------------------------
 CL-WIKI    Wiki Engine for Common Lisp
=========   ---------------------------

http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-wiki/


Quick start
===========

        (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :cl-wiki)
        ;; Write config file "wiki.conf" in current directory with at least
        ;; (base (directory "/path/to/wiki-data/"))
        ;; ...
        (wiki:start)

Then direct your browser to http://localhost:5757/cl-wiki/Somepage


CL-WIKI uses Hunchentoot <http://weitz.de/hunchentoot/>. The example above
runs it without any front-end. But you can install it for use with Apache and
mod_lisp, too. See Hunchentoot's documentation.

Syntax highlighting via lisppaste's colorizing code
<http://common-lisp.net/project/lisppaste/>. See colorize-README.


Config
======

File "wiki.conf" in current directory.
Example:

  ;;; -*- Mode: LISP; Syntax: COMMON-LISP; Package: CL-USER; Base: 10 -*-

  ;; Config file for CL-WIKI -- Wiki engine for Common Lisp
  (base (port 5757
         directory "/home/stesch/wiki-data"
         url "/cl-wiki/"
         page-list ((title "Home"    link "Home")
                    (title "About"   link "About")
                    (title "Contact" link "Contact"))))


The following parameters can be set with the config file:

Section: base
-------------
directory       Base directory for the wiki data, like pages, etc.

port            TCP/IP port CL-WIKI will listen to. Attention: listens
                on every interface.

template-directory      Base directory for templates.

page-list       List of title-link pairs with links that get displayed on
                the top and bottom of every page. See example above how to
                set this.

reverse-proxy   Indicates if CL-WIKI runs behind a reverse proxy.
                Default is NIL. Set it to t when behind a proxy.

home-page       Default page when root directory of the site is accessed.

edit-textarea-size      Plist of size of edit textarea.
                        Default is (:rows 25 :cols 80).


Textformatting
==============

[[Page]]                        ==> Generates a link to named page.
[[Page|Text]]                   ==> Generates a link to named page
                                    and links Text.
[http://www.somepage.example/]  ==> Inserts external link
''text''                        ==> emphasize text (<em>text</em>) 
                                    -- on most browsers italic
'''text'''                      ==> stronger emphasize text
                                    (<strong>text</strong>)
                                    -- on most browsers bold
<small>text</small>             ==> text in small font
<big>text</big>                 ==> text in big font
<sub>x</sub>                    ==> subscripting x
<sup>x</sup>                    ==> superscripting x
<s>text</s>                     ==> strike out text
<u>text</u>                     ==> underline text
<del>text</del>                 ==> Mark text as deleted
<ins>text</ins>                 ==> Mark text as inserted
<br> or <br/>                   ==> Start a new line
* Item                          ==> List item

= Foo =                         ==> Level 1 header (discouraged)

== Foo ==                       ==> Level 2 header

...                             ...

====== Foo ======               ==> Level 6 header

----                            ==> Horizontal divider

<source> ... </source>          ==> Sourcecode snippet
                                    <pre class="code"> ... </pre>

<source lang="LANG"> ... </source>
                                ==> Sourcecode snippet, colorized for the
                                    named language LANG.
                                    Snippet is surrounded by
                                    <div class="code"> ... </div>
                                    LANG must be one of "Basic Lisp", "Scheme",
                                    "Emacs Lisp", "Common Lisp", "C", "C++",
                                    "Java", "Objective C", "Erlang", "Python",
                                    or "Haskell"

<nowiki> ... </nowiki>          ==> Excludes a portion of the text from code
                                    converting. Useful if you want to show
                                    the formatting codes on a help page, etc.

<!-- comment -->                ==> Removes everything between <!-- and -->.
                                    Allows commenting.


Philosophy
==========

The term "wiki wiki" and its meaning are well known. Quick. Quick to use
and quick to program. The first wiki was written in 30 lines of Perl
code.
